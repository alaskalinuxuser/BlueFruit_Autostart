# BlueFruit Autostart

Here is my work on a home built bluetooth autostart that uses a BlueFruit nRF52 board at it's core.

The entire build process, my thoughts, and actions are can be read here:

# Programming Folder

Here you will find the program sketch that I made in Arduino IDE to program the nRF52 Adafruit BlueFruit board. You will need to add the Adafruit nRF52 boards through the board manager in the IDE to utilize this sketch.


You will also find the Android program that I modified from Adafruit to make my autostart app. This is written for Android Studio 2.3. Newer versions of Android Studio will require some modification to the files.

# Video and Pictures Folders

Here you can see pictures throughout the process, as well as a video of the final result.

# Schematics Folder

In this folder is the original concept schematic for the autostart. There is also the schematics for the 1993 GMC K3500 pickup truck that I installed this in. Those drawings have been marked for which wires I connected to.

# Info Folder

This folder includes information on the Adafruit BlueFruit board I used. This is not my work, only shared here so one can see how the bluetooth board works.
